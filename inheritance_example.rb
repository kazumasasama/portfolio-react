# Use the terminal to create a new file in your practice-ruby folder called inheritance_example.rb and open it in your text editor.
# • Copy the Car and Bicycle class into your file: https://gist.github.com/peterxjang/e9b69b4de36b2c41ef4b
# • Use inheritance to DRY up the classes. Note - a car is NOT in a type of bicycle, and a bicycle is NOT a type of car!
# • To test it, create a bicycle and car instance from your newly modified classes (you can create them at the bottom of your file). First, have them accelerate. Then, make sure a bike can “Ring ring!” and a car “Beeeeeeep!”
# Bonus: Read more about inheritance and object hierarchy in Ruby here: https://www.leighhalliday.com/object-hierarchy-in-ruby
