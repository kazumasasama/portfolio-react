# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# print "Enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# puts word.upcase

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

# print "Enter a number: "
# num = gets.chomp.to_i
# if num > 100
#   puts "That's a big number"
# end

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.
# nums = []
# puts "Enter two numbers one at a time"
# print "number1: "
# nums << gets.chomp.to_i
# print "number2: "
# nums << gets.chomp.to_i

# puts nums.sum

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# print "Enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp

# puts word.reverse

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

# print "Enter a number: "
# puts num = gets.chomp.to_i * 10

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

# puts "Enter two words one at a time"
# print "word1: "
# word1 = gets.chomp.upcase
# print "word2: "
# word2 = gets.chomp.upcase
# puts "#{word1} #{word2}"



# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

# print "Enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# puts word.length

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# print "Enter a number: "
# num = gets.chomp.to_i
# if num < 0
#   puts "That's a negative number"
# end

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# puts "Enter two numbers one at a time"
# print "number1: "
# num1 = gets.chomp.to_i
# print "number2: "
# num2 = gets.chomp.to_i
# puts num1 * num2


# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.

# print "Enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# if word.length > 5
#   puts "That's a long word"
# end
