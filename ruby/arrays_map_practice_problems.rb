#  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number times 3.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9].

# p nums.map{|num| num * 3}
# nums = [1, 2, 3]

#  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string upcased.
#     For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes ["HELLO", "GOODBYE"].

# words = ["hello", "goodbye"]
# p words.map{|word| word.upcase}

#  3. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array of string values from each hash's :name key.
#     For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes ["Alice", "Blane"].

# people = [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}]
# p people.map{|key, value| key[:name]}

#  4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number plus 7.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [8, 9, 10].

# array = [1, 2, 3]
# p array.map{|num| num + 7}

#  5. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string's length.
#     For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes [5, 7].

# words = ["hello", "goodbye"]
# p words.map{|word| word.length}

#  6. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array of number values from each hash's :age key.
#     For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes [27, 16].

# people = [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}]
# p people.map{|person| person[:age]}

#  7. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number divided by 2.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [0.5, 1.0, 1.5].

# nums = [1, 2, 3]
# p nums.map{|num| num / 2.0 }

#  8. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string's first letter only.
#     For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes ["h", "g"].

# words = ["hello", "goodbye"]
# p words.map{|word| word[0]}

# 9.  Start with an array of hashes and create a new array of number values from each hash's :age key times 2.
#     For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes [54, 32].

# people = [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}]
# p people.map{|person| person[:age] * 2 }

# 10. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number converted into a string.
#     For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes ["1", "2", "3"].

# nums = [1, 2, 3]
# p nums.map{|num| num.to_s}
