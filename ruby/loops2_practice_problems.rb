# 1. Write a while loop to print the numbers 1 through 10.

# nums = [*(1..10)]
# i = 0
# while i < nums.length
#   p nums[i]
#   i += 1
# end

# 2. Write a while loop that prints the word "hello" 5 times.

# i = 0
# while i < 5
#   p "hello"
#   i += 1
# end

# 3. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever until the user enters the word "stop".

# while true
#   puts "Enter a word: "
#   word = gets.chomp
#   if word == "stop"
#     break
#   end
# end

# 4. Write a while loop that prints the numbers 0 through 100, increasing by 5 each time.

# i = 0
# while i <= 100
#   p i
#   i += 5
# end

# 5. Write a while loop that prints the number 9000 ten times.

# i = 0
# while i < 10
#   p 9000
#   i += 1
# end

# 6. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a number and will run forever until the user enters a number greater than 10.

# while true
#   p "enter a number: "
#   num = gets.chomp.to_i
#   if num > 10
#     break
#   end
# end

# 7. Write a while loop that prints the numbers 50 to 70.

# i = 50
# while i <= 70
#   p i
#   i += 1
# end

# 8. Write a while loop that prints the phrase "Around the world" 144 times.

# i = 1
# while i < 145
#   p "Around the world"
#   i += 1
# end

# 9. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever until the user enters a word with more than 5 letters.

# while true
#   p "enter a word: "
#   word = gets.chomp
#   if word.length > 5
#     break
#   end
# end

# 10. Write a while loop that prints the even numbers from 2 to 40.

# nums = [*(0..40)]
# i = 2
# while i <= nums[-1]
#   p nums[i]
#   i += 2
# end
