# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# print "Enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# p word.upcase

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

# print "Enter a number: "
# num = gets.chomp.to_i
# if num > 100
#   p "That's a big number"
# end

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# puts "Enter two numbers one at a time."
# nums = []
# print "Number 1: "
# nums << gets.chomp.to_i
# print "Number 2: "
# nums << gets.chomp.to_i
# p nums.sum

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# print "Enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# p word.reverse

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

# print "Enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# p word * 10

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

# puts "Enter two words one at a time."
# words = []
# print "Word 1: "
# words << gets.chomp
# print "Word 2: "
# words << gets.chomp
# p "#{words[0]} #{words[1]}".upcase

# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

# puts "Enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# p word.length

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# puts "Enter a number"
# num = gets.chomp.to_i
# if num < 0
#   p "That's a negative number"
# end

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# puts "Enter two numbers one at a time."
# nums = []
# print "Number 1: "
# nums << gets.chomp.to_i
# print "Number 2: "
# nums << gets.chomp.to_i
# p nums[0] * nums[1]

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.

# print "Enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# if word.length > 5
#   p "That's a long word"
# end
