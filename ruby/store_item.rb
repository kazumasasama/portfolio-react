# C. Use hashes with symbols to represent the following scenario:

# C.1 - You are the owner of a store that sells items (you decide what specifically). Each item has various properties such as color, price, etc.

# apple = {
#   :color => "Red",
#   :price => 1.00,
#   :brand => "Fuji",
# }

# banana = {
#   :color => "Yellow",
#   :price => 5.00,
#   :brand => "Banannnnaa",
# }

# pinapple = {
#   :color => "",
#   :price => 6.00,
#   :brand => "whatever",
# }


apple = {
  color: "Red",
  price: 1.00,
  brand: "Fuji",
}

banana = {
  color: "Yellow",
  price: 5.00,
  brand: "Banannnnaa",
}

pinapple = {
  color: "Yellow",
  price: 6.00,
  brand: "whatever",
}


p apple
p banana
p pinapple


# C.2 - Represent 3 items using hashes. Each hash should have the same keys with different values.



# C.3 - Be sure to use symbols for the keys. Try creating hashes using both types of hash symbol syntaxes. (Ruby syntax {:a => 123} vs. “JavaScript” syntax {a: 123}).
# Bonus: Read more about Ruby array and hash methods. Explore using different methods in your code.
