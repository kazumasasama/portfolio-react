# Spend the next 5 minutes decomposing the following problem (just decompose the problem, do not write any code to actually solve the problem for now):
#   Write code to keep track of the score of a game of bowling. It should have two methods: roll which takes in the number of pins knocked down, and score which is called at the end and returns the total game score.



# write two empty methods

#  regular process: 1投目と2投目の合計
#  spare:

# ロールの役割　＝＝＝＝＝
# 全部で20ロール
