# # 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).
# first_name = "Nobi"
# last_name = "Nobita"
# puts first_name + " " + last_name

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# first_name = "Big"
# last_name = "G"
# puts "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# print "Enter a word: "
# word = gets.chomp
# if word == "marco"
#   p "polo"
# end

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

# color_1 = "red"
# color_2 = "blue"
# color_3 = "black"
# puts color_1 + " " + color_2 + " " + color_3

# 5. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# color_1 = "red"
# color_2 = "blue"
# color_3 = "black"
# puts "#{color_1}, #{color_2}, #{color_3}"

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."

# print "Enter a name: "
# name = gets.chomp
# if name != "Santa"
#   p "You're not Santa."
# end

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# title = "The World"
# author = "No Name"
# puts title + ": Written by " + author

# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# title = "The World"
# author = "No Name"
# puts "#{title}: was written by #{author}"

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"

# print "Enter your password: "
# password = gets.chomp
# if password == "Joshua"
#   p "Shall we play a game?"
# else
#   p "Access denied"
# end

# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# city_1 = "New York"
# city_2 = "Chicago"
# city_3 = "San Fransisco"
# puts city_1 + city_2 + city_3
